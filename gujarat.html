      <h2><u>Food</u></h2>
      <p>Telangana, a state in southern India, has a rich culinary heritage with a variety of delicious dishes such as:<br>
        ● <b>Hyderabadi Biryani:</b> This dish is known for its fragrant basmati rice, tender meat (usually chicken, mutton, or goat), aromatic spices, saffron, and caramelized onions.

        ● <b>Hyderabadi Haleem:</b> Hyderabadi Haleem is a signature dish from Hyderabad, Telangana, especially popular during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. It is a slow-cooked stew that combines wheat, barley, lentils, and meat, usually beef or mutton. The ingredients are simmered together for hours until they form a thick, creamy consistency. The dish is flavored with a blend of aromatic spices such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and ginger-garlic paste. Garnishes like fried onions, fresh herbs like coriander and mint, and a dash of lime juice add a burst of flavors to the rich and hearty Haleem.<br>
        ● <b>Mirchi Bajji:</b> Mirchi Bajji is a popular street food snack in Telangana and other parts of South India. It features large green chilies, such as the less spicy ones like Bhavnagri or Guntur chilies, which are slit and deseeded before being dipped in a spiced chickpea flour batter. The batter typically includes ingredients like gram flour (besan), rice flour, salt, turmeric, and sometimes a pinch of baking soda for extra crispiness. The coated chilies are then deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. Mirchi Bajji is often served hot and crispy, accompanied by tangy tamarind chutney or spicy green chutney. Some variations also include a stuffing made from a mix of spices, onions, and sometimes peanuts or grated coconut.<br>
        ● <b>Pulihora: </b> Pulihora, also known as tamarind rice, is a tangy and flavorful rice dish that is a staple in Telangana cuisine, especially during festivals, religious ceremonies, and special occasions.

Other essential ingredients include roasted peanuts or cashews, curry leaves, mustard seeds, turmeric, and a tempering of spices like dried red chilies and fenugreek seeds in hot oil. Pulihora can have variations in taste and texture based on regional preferences, with some adding grated coconut or jaggery for a hint of sweetness. It is typically served with a side of crunchy papad or fried lentil snacks.<br>
        ● <b>Gongura Pachadi:</b> Gongura Pachadi is a spicy and tangy chutney or pickle made from gongura leaves, also known as sorrel leaves. These leaves have a distinctive sour taste that adds a unique flavor profile to the dish. To prepare Gongura Pachadi, gongura leaves are thoroughly washed and then sautéed with a mix of spices like mustard seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, dried red chilies, and garlic in oil until the leaves wilt and release their juices. The mixture is then ground into a coarse paste, sometimes with the addition of tamarind for extra tanginess. Gongura Pachadi pairs exceptionally well with hot steamed rice and a dollop of ghee, enhancing the overall taste experience.<br>
        ● <b>Sakinalu:</b> Sakinalu is a traditional snack from Telangana, often made during festivals like Sankranti (a harvest festival). It is a crispy and savory snack made from a batter of rice flour, sesame seeds, cumin seeds, and sometimes a pinch of ajwain (carom seeds) for flavor.
