      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>Karnataka's cuisine is a delightful reflection of its diverse cultural influences and rich culinary heritage. Here are some must-try dishes that showcase the flavors and variety of Karnataka's food:<br>
        ● <b>Bisi Bele Bath:</b> Bisi Bele Bath is a quintessential Karnataka dish that translates to "hot lentil rice" in Kannada. It is a flavorful one-pot meal made by cooking rice, toor dal (pigeon peas), mixed vegetables (like carrots, beans, peas), tamarind extract, and a unique spice blend called "bisi bele bath powder." This powder typically contains spices like coriander seeds, red chilies, cinnamon, cloves, and fenugreek seeds. The dish is cooked until the flavors meld together, and it is then garnished with ghee-fried cashews, peanuts, and curry leaves. Bisi Bele Bath is often served hot with a dollop of ghee and a side of crispy papad or raita.<br>
        ● <b>Neer Dosa: </b> Neer Dosa is a light and delicate crepe originating from coastal Karnataka and parts of Kerala. The batter is made by grinding soaked rice and fresh coconut with water to a thin consistency, giving the dosa its name ("neer" means water in Kannada). Unlike traditional dosas, Neer Dosa doesn't require fermentation and is cooked quickly on a hot griddle to create thin, lacy crepes. It pairs perfectly with coconut chutney, sambar, or even a simple jaggery-coconut mixture for a sweet variation.<br>
        ● <b>Saaru: </b>  Saaru is a comforting and flavorful lentil-based stew that is a staple in Karnataka cuisine. To prepare Saaru, toor dal (or a combination of lentils) is cooked until soft and then blended into a smooth consistency. A mixture of spices, including coriander powder, cumin, fenugreek, asafoetida, and tamarind pulp, is added to create a tangy and aromatic broth. Vegetables like tomatoes, carrots, and beans are often added for texture and nutrition. Saaru is usually served hot with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee, making it a wholesome and satisfying meal.<br>
        ● <b>Kosambari: </b> Kosambari is a refreshing and nutritious salad that is popular in Karnataka households and served during festivals and special occasions. It is made by soaking split green gram (moong dal) in water until slightly soft and then mixing it with finely chopped cucumber, carrot, coconut, coriander leaves, and a tempering of mustard seeds, green chilies, curry leaves, and lemon juice or tamarind pulp. Kosambari provides a crunchy texture, protein from the lentils, and a burst of flavors from the fresh ingredients and spices.<br>
        ● <b>Mangalore Bajji: </b> Mangalore Bajji, also known as Mangalore Bonda or Goli Baje, is a popular snack from the coastal region of Karnataka, especially Mangalore. It involves making a batter from gram flour (besan), rice flour, yogurt, and spices like cumin, ginger, green chilies, and curry leaves. The batter is then used to coat various fillings like chopped onions, green chilies, diced potatoes, or even prawns and fish, which are then deep-fried until golden and crispy. Mangalore Bajjis are best enjoyed hot with coconut chutney or a tangy tomato-based dip.<br>
        ● <b>Jolada Rotti:</b> Jolada Rotti is a traditional flatbread made from jowar (sorghum) flour, popularly consumed in North Karnataka. The gluten-free flour is mixed with water and kneaded into a soft dough, which is then flattened and cooked on a hot griddle or tava without any oil. Jolada Rotti is known for its earthy flavor and is often served with spicy chutneys, spicy curries like Yennegai (spicy stuffed brinjal), or Saaru for a wholesome meal.<br>
        ● <b>Pandi Curry: </b> Pandi Curry is a spicy and aromatic pork curry that originates from the coastal region of Mangalore and Coorg (Kodagu) in Karnataka. The curry is made by marinating pork pieces with a blend of roasted spices like coriander seeds, cumin, peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, and dry red chilies. It is then cooked with onions, tomatoes, grated coconut, tamarind extract, and sometimes a dash of vinegar or kachampuli (a local Coorgi souring agent). Pandi Curry is known for its rich flavors, tender meat, and is often paired with Akki Roti (rice roti) or steamed rice.<br>
        ● <b>Ragi Malt: </b>Ragi (finger millet) malt is a nutritious beverage enjoyed in Karnataka and other parts of South India. Ragi flour is mixed with water or milk, sweetened with jaggery or sugar, and flavored with cardamom powder, grated coconut, and sometimes chopped nuts like almonds or cashews. The mixture is then cooked until it thickens slightly, resulting in a wholesome and refreshing drink that is rich in calcium, iron, and fiber. Ragi Malt is especially popular during hot summers as it is cooling and energizing.<br>
        ● <b>Masala Dosa: </b>Masala Dosa is perhaps one of the most iconic South Indian dishes enjoyed across Karnataka and beyond. The dosa batter is made from fermented rice and urad dal (black gram), creating a crispy and golden-brown crepe when cooked on a griddle. The dosa is then filled with a spiced potato masala made from boiled potatoes, onions, green chilies, mustard seeds, turmeric, and curry leaves. Masala Dosas are typically served with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, sambar, and a small serving of ghee for added richness.<br>
